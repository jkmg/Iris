# This app predicts the type of iris plant ('Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor' and 'Iris-virginica') from the paramters sepal length, sepal wid#th and petal width in cm. Data to generate the model were obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris)
# To run the app do:
# 1. "conda create -n venv"
# 2. "conda activate venv"
# 3. "conda install pip"
# 4. "pip install -r requirements.txt"
# 5. "streamlit run src/main.py"

# Predictive model generation is described in the Jupyter Notebook Iris.ipynb
# Dataset used for model generation can be found in Iris.csv
